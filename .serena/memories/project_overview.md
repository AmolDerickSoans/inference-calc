# Project Overview

## Purpose
This is an **AI Infrastructure Profitability Calculator** designed to help users analyze the return on investment (ROI) for running AI models on various GPU configurations.

## Key Features
- **LLM Calculator**: Analyzes profitability for running language models (LLMs) on different GPUs
- **Image & Video Calculator**: Calculates ROI for image and video generation models
- **Voice Calculator**: Analyzes profitability for voice/audio AI models
- **GPU Estimator**: Helps plan GPU cluster requirements for specific workloads
- **Reference Data**: Provides competitor pricing and GPU specifications

## Use Cases
- Determining profitable GPU rental configurations
- Comparing different cloud providers (Cudo, RunPod, RunPod Serverless)
- Analyzing pricing strategies with different markup levels
- Understanding the impact of GPU utilization on profitability
- Planning infrastructure for AI model deployment

## Key Metrics Analyzed
- Revenue per hour/month
- Profit/loss per hour/month
- Cost per unit (token, image, video, job)
- Utilization rates
- Breakeven analysis

## Origin
This project was created with AI Studio (Google) and is a web-based profitability analysis tool.
